This repository is a fork of [typechain-target-truffle](https://github.com/ethereum-ts/TypeChain/tree/master/packages/typechain-target-truffle) package to make it compatible with Truffle v5.
With this version Truffle [moved](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/releases/tag/v5.0.0) from [Web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/) v0.x to v1.x. One of major change in it: use of [BN.js](https://github.com/indutny/bn.js/) instead of [bignumber.js](https://mikemcl.github.io/bignumber.js/). This change affects types generated by TypeChain.

Changes are merged from [@MicahZoltu pull request](https://github.com/ethereum-ts/TypeChain/pull/184) to [#bignumber-to-bn](https://github.com/pash7ka/TypeChain/tree/bignumber-to-bn) branch.

Usage:
```
yarn add git+https://github.com/pash7ka/TypeChain/#dist-typechain-target-truffle
```
